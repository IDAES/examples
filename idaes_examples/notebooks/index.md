# IDAES examples

## About this documentation

This documentation contains examples for the IDAES platform {cite}`miller2018idaes`.
The examples and tutorials are all Jupyter Notebooks.
The examples you see in the web pages are compiled into  very nice HTML by the excellent [JupyterBook]
(https://jupyterbook.org) software.

All the documentated examples are rigorously *tested* to ensure that work with the latest versions of the IDAES 
software.

There are a number of examples that are not in the documentation.
These fall into two categories:

  - "Archived" examples that are no longer tested against the current version of IDAES. They may work, they may not.
  - "Active" examples that *are* tested against the current version of IDAES.

When you install the examples as a Python package, you get all of these.
See {ref}`installing` for details.
