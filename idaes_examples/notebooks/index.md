# IDAES examples

This documentation contains examples for the IDAES platform.

## About IDAES

The Institute for Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES) 
{cite}`miller2018idaes` was originated to bring the 
most advanced modeling and 
optimization capabilities to the challenges of transforming and decarbonizing the worldâ€™s energy systems to make them 
environmentally sustainable while maintaining high reliability and low cost.
For more information please see the [IDAES website](https://idaes.org/) and the online 
[IDAES documentation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## About this documentation

The examples in this documentation show how to create, configure, and solve IDAES models for a variety of application.
Some of the examples are written in a tutorial style with separate "exercise" and "solution" sections to
facilitate use in a group setting.

All of the examples are written in Python as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks.
You can browse these notebooks online or download them to and run on your own machine.
The online examples have been created with the 
[JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org) software package.

### Prerequisites

Examples in this documentation are rigorously *tested* to ensure that they work with the *latest* version of the IDAES 
software. 
For more information on installing IDAES on your platform,
please refer to the [IDAES documentation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
