# Introduction

This documentation contains examples for the IDAES platform.

## About IDAES

The Institute for Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES) 
{cite}`miller2018idaes` was originated to bring the 
most advanced modeling and 
optimization capabilities to the challenges of transforming and decarbonizing the worldâ€™s energy systems to make them 
environmentally sustainable while maintaining high reliability and low cost.
For more information please see the [IDAES website](https://idaes.org/) and the online 
[IDAES documentation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## About this documentation

The examples in this documentation show how to create, configure, and solve IDAES models for a variety of application.
Some of the examples are written in a tutorial style with separate "exercise" and "solution" sections to
facilitate use in a group setting.

All of the examples are written in Python as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks.
You can browse these notebooks online or download them to and run on your own machine.
The online examples have been created with the 
[JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org) software package.

### Prerequisites

**Install the latest version of IDAES.** Examples in this documentation are rigorously *tested* to ensure that they work with the *latest* version of the IDAES 
software. 
For more information on installing IDAES on your platform,
please refer to the [IDAES documentation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

**Learn about mathematical optimization and Pyomo.** IDAES is a state-of-the-art equation-oriented modeling and optimization environment. Below are recommended topics and references:
* *Mathematical optimization* especially nonlinear programs (optimization problems) and chemical engineering applications. {cite}`Postek2025`, along with the [companion website](https://mobook.github.io/MO-book/intro.html) and [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPv-7TeSTNs), are the best resources for a user new to mathematical optimization. {cite}`biegler1997systematic`, {cite}`biegler2010nonlinear`, and {cite}`grossmann2021advanced` are excellent references for advanced users. The [Prof. Dowling's course website](https://ndcbe.github.io/optimization/intro.html) includes Jupyter notebooks and Pyomo examples inspired by these texts.
* *Pyomo*. IDAES is built upon Pyomo, which is an open-source algebraic modeling environment. New users will likely find {cite}`Postek2025` along its [companion website](https://mobook.github.io/MO-book/intro.html) and the [ND Pyomo Cookbook](https://ndcbe.github.io/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/README.html) as the easiest introduction to Pyomo. Other excellent resources include {cite}`bynum2021pyomo` and the [Pyomo documentation](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

### Getting the source code
The full source code for these examples is available from the 
[IDAES examples repository](https://github.com/IDAES/examples) on GitHub.
It may also be installed as a Python package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) with the command:

```
pip install idaes-examples
```

Please see the `README.md` file
in the [repository](https://github.com/IDAES/examples) for more information.
