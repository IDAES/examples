    "# CO2 Adsorption Desorption simulation example with a 1D Fixed Bed model\n",

    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook shows an example of a CO2 Adsorption Desorption cycle with the IDAES 1D FixedBed model. The IDAES 1D FixedBed model is a dynamic and axially varying reactor/adsorption model which is able to model the gas and solid interactions of the modeled species in detail. The sorbent used for this example is the NETL_32D sorbent with its details and parameters obtained from the following references: \n",
    "- A. Lee, D.C. Miller, A One-Dimensional (1-D) Three-Region Model for a Bubbling Fluidized-Bed Adsorber, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 52 (2013) 469–484\n",
    "- Lee, A.; Mebane, D.; Fauth, D. J.; Miller, D. C. A Model for the Adsorption Kinetics of CO2 on Amine-Impregnated Mesoporous Sorbents in the Presence of Water. Presented at the 28th International Pittsburgh Coal Conference, Pittsburgh, PA, 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates how to use the IDAES 1DFixedBed model for an adsorption/desorption application with distinct adsorption and desorption steps. This example leverages custom libraries and functions specific to the NETL_32D solid sorbent and associated gas phase properties and surface reactions. In this system, the silicon monoxide (SiO(s)) sorbent reduces carbon dioxide (CO2(g)) to carbamate (denoted Car(s)) while simultaneously absorbing water vapor (H2O(g)) to produce a solid solution-state hydrate (H2O(s)). The solid phase is considered a one-dimensional domain with three regions for bubble, cloud wake and emulsion properties for bubbling bed systems; in the case of a fixed bed reactor non-bulk gas behavior is neglected and assumed to be homogeneous everywhere not near the solid surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook also shows how to simulate the adsorption and desorption steps using the PETSc integrator. PETSc leverages nonlinear equation and differential algebraic equation solvers to solve time-trajectory problems. These solvers are applicable for systems with zero degrees of freedom, such as a fully-specified bed reactor model. See https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference_guides/core/solvers.html#petsc-utilities for more details."

    "This example demonstrates implementation of the 1D FixedBed model within IDAES. External property packages for multiple phase domains and interfaces, as well as mass transfer and reaction properties, were integrated into two simulations. The simulations are connected via their final (adsorption) and initial (desorption) states, and each utilizes the PETSc integrator to calculate temporal profiles over the spatial domains."
