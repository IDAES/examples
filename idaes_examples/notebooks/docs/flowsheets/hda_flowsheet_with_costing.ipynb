    "In this example, IDAES Process Costing Framework methods were applied to two HDA flowsheets for capital cost estimation. The costing blocks calls showcased multiple methods to define unit costing, demonstrating the flexibility and best practice of the costing framework. In the basic examples, the two-flash HDA did not include costing and the distillation HDA estimated a reactor capital cost comprising 3.3% of the total plant cost (TPC). With more rigorous costing, IDAES obtained total capital costs of 8.5% TPC (two flash HDA) and 9.6% (distillation HDA) and better modeled the impact of equipment cost on process economics. As printed above, the IDAES Process Costing Framework confirmed that replacing the second flash drum with a distillation column results in increased equipment costs, increased production and decreased cost per unit product."
