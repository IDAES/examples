    "# Methanol Synthesis Flowsheet Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate flowsheet synthesis integrating IDAES modeling tools, including the Unit Model Library, Property and Reaction Framework, IDAES scaling tools and the Process Costing Framework. The example leverages imports from external flowsheet scripts, and demonstrates implementation of separate VLE and vapor-only property packages to reduce model complexity where applicable.\n",

    "This example demonstrates a steady-state model of methanol synthesis from hydrogen and carbon monoxide. To simulate relevant natural gas components, the reactant vapors are mixed stoichiometrically and brought to optimal reaction conditions prior to entering the gas-phase reactor. Vapor liquid equilibrium is mainly applicable in the post-reactor Flash unit for methanol recovery, and is accounted for by separate vapor and VLE thermophysical property packages. See `methanol_flowsheet.py` for more information on how to assemble the flowsheet, as well as [idaes_examples.mod.methanol.methanol_ideal_VLE.py](https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse/tree/main/pkg/idaes_examples/common/methanol/methanol_ideal_VLE.py), [idaes_examples.mod.methanol.methanol_ideal_vapor](https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse/tree/main/pkg/idaes_examples/common/methanol/methanol_ideal_vapor.py) and [idaes_examples.mod.methanol.methanol_reactions](https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse/tree/main/pkg/idaes_examples/common/methanol/methanol_reactions.py) for more information on the thermophyscial and reaction properties.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates a simulation of methanol synthesis from hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Each methanol flowsheet module includes several built-in methods. This notebook demonstrates building the flowsheet, implementing model scaling, initialization and solving a square problem, costing and final constrainted optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```build_model()``` method creates the Pyomo concrete model and builds the flowsheet by importing thermophysical and reaction properties and unit models and defining stream connections between these units. This method also implements appropriate default scaling on state and property variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```set_inputs()``` method adds the appropriate initial specifications on the feed streams and unit operations. Specifications upstream of the reactor largely remain fixed throughout the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```scale_flowsheet()``` method implements generic variable, unit model state variable, unit model constraint and Arc equality constraint scaling via IDAES scaling tools. Scaling factors are hard-coded in the flowsheet scripts to adjust for order of magnitude factors in appropriate constraints and simplify numerical solver calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```initialize_flowsheet()``` method uses the initial guess to initialize the models sequentially, solving each unit and propagating the results to the outlet stream to converge the next unit more quickly. This occurs just before the flowsheet-level solver call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```add_costing()``` method creates new variables and constraints related to unit model capital cost and operating cost calculations, and defines an objective function for the process economics. This method is called after the flowsheet-level solver call, and the flowsheet is resolved once costing is added. Capital costs are estimated using built-in costing methods within IDAES, and operating costs are estimated from a combination of known cost coefficients and surrogate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```report()``` method displays relevant model results after the flowsheet has been fully solved."

    "\n",
    "To increase the efficiency of the process as well as overall methanol production and revenue, we can add a recycle stream to send most of the Flash vapor back to the start of the process. This will reduce methanol loss in the exhaust and increase feed utilization, resulting in increased operating costs and increased production (revenue) at the same conversion. Note that for conversions less than 100%, a simulation with no purge will never converge due to accumulation of gases within the system. Therefore, to ensure we close the mass balance we set a lower bound at 10% purge from the Flash vapor to the exhaust. We expect to see a marginal increase in operating costs due to increased flow, and a much larger increase in overall production resulting in a higher total revenue.\n",

The code below calls an initialization method to automatically determine the tear stream.

    "As before, we will first build the flowsheet, set required inputs, initialize and solve a square problem. Recycling methanol to pre-reactor blocks complicates VLE calculations, and limiting VLE calculations to the Flash unit and liquid Product block greatly increases tractability during initialization. All initial feed and unit specifications are identical to the non-recycle case; the Sequential Decomposition algorithm automatically selects the compressor feed as the tear stream and uses \"no recycle\" results as a first guess. In the output below, the solver solves all units and then resolves select blocks with updated inlet results, followed by a full flowsheet solve:"

Note that the reaction conversion and flash inlet temperature did not change, and we obtain the same percentage methanol recovery. We can see in the stream tables that far more of the inlet material exits as methanol than in the non-recycle process (note that we do not have a mole balance due to the reaction stoichiometry). The results show a slight increase in equipment and operating costs from increased throughput on each unit."

The methanol synthesis flowsheet methods may be imported into any external script, and users may build, initialize and optimize the entire model via the `main()` method in each flowsheet."
