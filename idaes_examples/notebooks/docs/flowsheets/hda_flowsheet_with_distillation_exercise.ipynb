    "\n",

    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will be similar to the HDA flowsheet tutorial in the Tutorials section, except that we use a distillation column instead of a second flash (F102) to produce benzene and toluene products.\n",

    "Hydrodealkylation is a chemical reaction that often involves reacting\n",
    "an aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence of hydrogen gas to form a\n",
    "simpler aromatic hydrocarbon devoid of functional groups. In this\n",
    "example, toluene will be reacted with hydrogen gas at high temperatures\n",
    " to form benzene via the following reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "**C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + CH<sub>4</sub>**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This reaction is often accompanied by an equilibrium side reaction\n",
    "which forms diphenyl, which we will neglect for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is based on the 1967 AIChE Student Contest problem as\n",
    "present by Douglas, J.M., Chemical  Design of Chemical Processes, 1988,\n",
    "McGraw-Hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowsheet that we will be using for this module is shown below with the stream conditions. We will be processing toluene and hydrogen to produce at least 370 TPY of benzene. As shown in the flowsheet, we use a flash tank, F101, to separate out the non-condensibles, and a distillation column, D101, to further separate the benzene-toluene mixture to improve the benzene purity.  The non-condensibles separated out in F101 will be partially recycled back to M101 and the rest will be purged. We will assume ideal gas behavior for this flowsheet. The properties required for this module are defined in\n",

    "We will be using two thermodynamic packages: one (first in the list above) containing all four components (i.e., toluene, hydrogen, benzene, and methane) and the other (second in the list above) containing benzene and toluene only. The latter is needed to simplify the VLE calculations in the distillation column model. \n",

    "## Translator block\n",
    "\n",
    "Benzene and toluene are separated by distillation, so the process involves phase equilibrium and two-phase flow conditions. However, the presence of hydrogen and methane complicates the calculations. This is because, hydrogen and methane are non-condensable under all conditions of interest; ergo, a vapor phase will always be present, and the mixture bubble point is extremely low. To simplify the phase equilibrium calculations, hydrogen and methane will be considered completely as non-condensable and insoluble in the liquid outlet from the flash F101.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since no hydrogen and methane will be present in the unit operations following the flash, a different component list can be used to simplify the property calculations. IDAES supports the definition of multiple property packages within a single flowsheet via `Translator` blocks. `Translator` blocks convert between different property calculations, component lists, and equations of state.

Consequently, the flow rate of the stream s03 is simply the sum of the flowrates of the toluene feed and hydrogen feed streams. Further, since the temperature and the pressure of both the toluene and hydrogen feed streams are the same, we specify their values as the initial guess for the temperature and pressure of the stream s03."

    "Next, we need to tell the tool how to initialize a particular unit. We will be writing a python function which takes in a \"unit\" and calls the initialize method on that unit. For the initialization, we will import a Block Triangularization Initializer which decomposes the model into a set of subproblems. These subproblems are solved using a block triangularization transformation before applying a simple Newton or user-selected solver. Methods such as block triangularization often solve faster and yield more reliable behavior than heuristic methods, but sometime struggle to decompose models with strongly coupled equations (e.g. column models, systems with counter-current flow, vapor-liquid equilibrium)."

    "Observe that the optimization was able to reduce the yearly operating cost from \\\\$427,593 to \\\\$408,342 (~4.5%). However, the amortized capital cost more than doubled from \\\\$14,704 to \\\\$29,927 due to the need to increase the conversion in the reactor (from 75% to 93%) to meet the production and purity constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, observe that the product flow rate and product purity are at their minimum values (0.18 mol/s and 99%, respectively). This is expected as increasing recovery would require more energy and cost to purify the product.\n",

    "Finally, observe that the operating temperature of the flash (F101) is almost at its lower bound. This helps in minimizing the amount of benzene in the vapor stream leaving the flash."
