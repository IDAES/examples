    "# Supercritical CO2 Property Surrogate with PySMO Surrogate Object - Training Surrogate (Part 1)\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the use of the PySMO Polynomial surrogate trainer to produce an ML surrogate based on supercritical CO2 data from simulation using REFPROP package. PySMO also has other training methods like Radial Basis Function and Kriging surrogate models, but we focus on Polynomial surrogate model. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons to build surrogate models for complex processes, even when higher fidelity models already exist (e.g., reduce model size, improve convergence reliability, replace models with externally compiled code and make them fully-equation oriented).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we intend to make a surrogate for the physical properties of S-CO2 to be embedded in the property package. This property package will be used to get the physical properties of S-CO2 in the flowsheet simulation. To learn more about property package, see the [IDAES-PSE](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse) Github Page or IDAES [Read-the-docs](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Need for ML Surrogates\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties predicted by the surrogate are enthalpy and entropy of the S-CO2 based on the \n",
    "pressure and temperature of the system. The analytical equation of getting the enthalpy and entropy from pressure and temperature are in the differential form and would make the problem a DAE system. To counter this problem and keep the problem algebraic, we will use the ML surrogates and relate enthalpy and entropy with the pressure and temperature as an algebraic equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Supercritical CO2 cycle process\n",
    "\n",
    "The following flowsheet will be used to optimize the design for the cooling of the fusion reactor using supercritical CO2 cycle. We shall focus on training the surrogate for this notebook and move to constructing the flowsheet and the properties package in the subsequent notebooks. The take away from this flowsheet is that, 3 variables can be measured in any given unit which are flow, pressure and temperature and other properties can be calculated using them. Thus, surrogate should have pressure and temperature as the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will train the model using polynomial regression for our data and then demonstrate that we can solve an optimization problem with that surrogate model. "

    "In this section, we read the dataset from the CSV file located in this directory. 500 data points were simulated for S-CO2 physical properties using REFPROP package. This example is trained on the entire dataset because neural  network can overfit on smaller dataset. The data is separated using an 80/20 split into training and validation data using the IDAES split_training_validation() method.\n",

Further, the input variables are **pressure**, **temperature** , while the output variables are **enth_mol**, **entr_mol**, hence we create two new dataframes for the input and output variables. "

    "IDAES builds a model class for each type of PySMO surrogate model. In this case, we will call and build the Polynomial Regression class. Regression settings can be directly passed as class arguments, as shown below. In this example, allowed basis terms span a 5th order polynomial, a variable product as well as a extra features are defined, and data is internally cross-validated using 10 iterations of 80/20 splits to ensure a robust surrogate fit. Note that PySMO uses cross-validation of training data to adjust model coefficients and ensure a more accurate fit, while we separate the validation dataset pre-training in order to visualize the surrogate fits.\n",
