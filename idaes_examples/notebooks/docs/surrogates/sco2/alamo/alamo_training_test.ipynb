        "This notebook demonstrates leveraging of the ALAMO surrogate trainer and IDAES Python wrapper to produce an surrogate based on supercritical CO2 data from simulation using REFPROP package.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several reasons to build surrogate models for complex processes, even when higher fidelity models already exist (e.g., reduce model size, improve convergence reliability, replace models with externally compiled code and make them fully-equation oriented).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we intend to make a surrogate for the physical properties of S-CO2 to be embedded in the property package. This property package will be used to get the physical properties of S-CO2 in the flowsheet simulation. To learn more about property package, see the [IDAES-PSE](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse) Github Page or IDAES [Read-the-docs](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \n",

        "pressure and temperature of the system. The analytical equation of getting the enthalpy and entropy from pressure and temperature are in the differential form and would make the problem a DAE system. To counter this problem and keep the problem algebraic, we will use the surrogates and relate enthalpy and entropy with the pressure and temperature as an algebraic equation.\n",

        "The following flowsheet will be used to optimize the design for the cooling of the fusion reactor using supercritical CO2 cycle. We shall focus on training the surrogate for this notebook and move to constructing the flowsheet and the properties package in the subsequent notebooks. The take away from this flowsheet is that, 3 variables can be measured in any given unit which are flow, pressure and temperature and other properties can be calculated using them. Thus, surrogate should have pressure and temperature as the inputs.\n",
