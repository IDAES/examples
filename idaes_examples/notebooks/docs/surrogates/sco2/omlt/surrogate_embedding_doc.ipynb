To integrate the surrogate we first define the physical parameter block which will return the properties based on the state variables. State variables would be called from the State Block as Pyomo variables. We will define the surrogate input and output as pyomo variables as well. Once we have defined the variables in the state block then we define our surrogate block.\n",

        "\n",
        "After defining the variables and constraints required to describe the properties of interest for S-CO2, we need to provide them with a good initial guess. It is often the case that the default values provided to the variables while creating the model are not likely the actual conditions the user would simulate. Given the highly non-linear nature of the physical property calculations, it is more often than not impossible to solve a State Block without providing a set of good initial values for all the variables we have declared.\n",
        "\n",
        "Any initialization routine can be written by following a 3 step process:\n",
        "1. `Fix the state` of the model such that there are no degrees of freedom. For State Blocks, it should only be necessary to fix the state variables to a set of initial guesses provided by the user or unit model, as well as deactivating any constraints like the sum of mole fractions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `Iteratively build up a solution` for the full model. This often involves multiple steps and can involve deactivating constraints and fixing some variables to reduce complexity, as well as analytically calculating values for variables based on the known state (and any previously calculated variables). Solvers can be called as part of any step to efficiently initialize large numbers of variables simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `Return the state of the model` to where it originally started (with the exception of variable values). Any variable that was fixed or constraint that was deactivated during initialization should be unfixed or reactivated, so that the degrees of freedom are restored to what they were before the initialization began.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, we start with fixing the state variables. Here since enth_mol and entr_mol are a function of pressure and temperature, we do not fix them as fixing pressure and temperature would inturn fix them. So, we check if a state variable if fixed or not, if it is fixed then we do not change them, if they are not fixed then we check for an initial guess from the `state_args`, if we get a value then we fix the variable with state_args, else we fix it with the value provided by the user. This should bring the degrees of freedom to 0. Here since we do not have any variable/constrained that we have unfixed/deactivated we can skip step 2 and move to step 3. We unfix the variables that were fixed in step 1 using the `release_state` function. "
