Problem Statement \n", "\n", "Within the context of a larger Natural Gas Fuel Cell (NGFC) system, the autothermal reformer unit is used to generate syngas from air, steam, and natural gas. Two input variables are considered for this example (reformer bypass fraction and fuel to steam ratio). The reformer bypass fraction (also called internal reformation percentage) plays an important role in the syngas final composition and it is typically controlled in this process. The fuel to steam ratio is an important variable that affects the final syngas reaction and heat duty required by the reactor.  The syngas is then used as fuel by a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) to generate electricity and heat. \n", "\n", "The autothermal reformer is typically modeled using the IDAES Gibbs reactor and this reactor is robust once it is initialized; however, the overall model robustness is affected due to several components present in the reaction, scaling issues for the largrangean multipliers, and Gibbs free energy minimization formulation.
