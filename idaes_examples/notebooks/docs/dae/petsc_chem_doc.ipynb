PETSc is a solver suite developed primarily by Argonne National Lab (https://petsc.org/release/).

The model implementation is standard Pyomo.DAE, and nothing special needs to be done in the model to use the PETSc solver.  The IDAES utilities for the PETSc solver will take the discretized Pyomo model and integrate between discrete time points to fill in the solution. To integrate over the entire time domain (as we will do here), you can discretize time using one time element, in which case, the problem will just contain the initial and final points.  The intermediate solutions can be read from the trajectory data saved by the solver.  The trajectory data can be used for analysis, or interpolation can be used to initialize a Pyomo problem before solving the fully time discretized problem.  Integrating over the entire time domain is fastest with a coarsely discretized model (ideally just a single finite element in time) because the model is smaller and there are fewer calls to the integrator.  This can be a good way to start testing a new dynamic IDAES model."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 2, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# To see the example problem code, uncomment the line below and execute this cell.\n", "# ??dae"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 3, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Get the model and known solution for y variables at t=180 minutes.\n", "m, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6 = dae(nfe=10)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The variables y1 to y6 represent concentrations of chemical species.
