    "- Demonstrate use of the Pump unit model in IDAES\n",
    "- Demonstrate different simulation options available\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will pump a stream of water at atmospheric pressure to a pressure of 201325 Pa using a simple pump unit model. We will be using the IAPWS property package for the water properties. It is assumed that the pump operates at steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inlet specifications are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flow Rate = 100 mol/s\n",
    "* Mole fraction (H2O) = 1\n",
    "* Pressure = 101325 Pa\n",
    "* Temperature = 298.15 K\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simulate 2 different cases, depending on the operating specifications by the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1**:In this case, we will specify the pump efficiency and the pressure increase variable on the pump unit model.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Pressure Increase = 100000 Pa\n",
    "   * Pump Efficiency = 0.8\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Case 2**: In this case, we will specify the pump efficiency but will specify the pressure of the outlet stream directly. \n",
    "   * Outlet Pressure = 201325 Pa\n",
    "   * Pump efficiency = 0.8\n",
