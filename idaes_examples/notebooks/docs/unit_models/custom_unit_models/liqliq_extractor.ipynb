    "# Custom Liquid - Liquid Extractor Unit Model\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a comprehensive step-wise procedure to build a custom unit model from scratch. This tutorial will include creating a property package, a custom unit model and testing them. For this tutorial we shall create a custom unit model for Liquid - Liquid Extraction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Liquid - Liquid Extractor model contains two immiscible fluids forming the two phases. One of the phase, say phase_1 has a high concentration of solutes which is to be separated. A mass transfer happens between the two phases and the solute is transfered from phase_1 to phase_2. This mass_transfer is governed by a parameter called distribution co-efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "After gaining the working principles of the Liquid - Liquid Extractor, we shall proceed to create a custom unit model, we would require a property package for each phase, a custom unit model class and then write the tests for the model and property packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before commencing the development of the model, we need to state some assumptions which the following unit model will be using. \n",
    "- Steady-state only\n",
    "- Organic phase property package has a single phase named Org\n",
    "- Aquoeus phase property package has a single phase named Aq\n",
    "- Organic and Aqueous phase properties need not have the same component list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus as per the assumptions, we will be creating one property package for the aqueous phase (Aq), and the other for the Organic phase (Org). "

    "# 1.2 Physical Parameter Data Block\n",
    "\n",
    "A Physical Parameter Block serves as the central point of reference for all aspects of the property package and needs to define several things about the package. These are summarized below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Units of measurement\n",
    "- What properties are supported and how they are implemented\n",
    "- What components and phases are included in the packages\n",
    "- All the global parameters necessary for calculating properties\n",
    "- A reference to the associated State Block class, so that construction of the State Block components can be automated from the Physical Parameter Block\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct this block, we begin by declaring a process block class using a Python decorator. One can learn more about `declare_process_block_class` [here](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/eea1209077b75f7d940d8958362e69d4650c079d/idaes/core/base/process_block.py#L173). After constructing the process block, we define a build function which contains all the components that the property package would have. `super` function here is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class and since this is used on the class `PhysicalParameterData` class, build has access to all the parent and sibling class methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Physical Parameter Block then refers to the `state block`, in this case `OrgPhaseStateBlock` (which will be declared later), so that we can build a state block instance by only knowing the `PhysicalParameterBlock` we wish to use. Then we move on to list the number of phases in this property package. Then we assign the variable to the phase which follows a naming convention. Like here since the solvent is in the Organic phase, we will assign the Phase as OrganicPhase and the variable will be named Org as per the naming convention. The details of naming conventions can be found [here](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/main/docs/explanations/conventions.rst). We will be following the same convention throughout the example. \n",
    " \n",
    "After defining the list of the phases, we move on to list the components and their type in the phase. It can be a solute or a solvent in the Organic phase. Thus, we define the component and assign it to either being a solute or a solvent. In this case, the salts are the solutes and Ethylene dibromide is the solvent. Next, we define the physical properties involved in the package, like the heat capacity and density of the solvent, the reference temperature, and the distribution factor that would govern the mass transfer from one phase into another. Additionally, a parameter, the `diffusion_factor`, is introduced. This factor plays a crucial role in governing mass transfer between phases, necessitating its definition within the state block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in creating the Physical Parameter Block is to declare a `classmethod` named `define_metadata`, which takes two arguments: a class (cls) and an instance of that class (obj). In this method, we will call the predefined method `add_default_units()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `obj.add_default_units()` sets the default units metadata for the property package, and here we define units to be used with this property package as default.  "

    "# 1.3 State Block\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `Physical Parameter Block` class has been created, the next step is to write the code necessary to create the State Blocks that will be used throughout the flowsheet. `StateBlock` contains all the information necessary to define the state of the system. This includes the state variables and constraints on those variables which are used to describe a state property like the enthalpy, material balance, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a State Block requires us to write two classes. The reason we write two classes is because of the inherent nature of how `declare_process_block_data` works. `declare_process_block_data` facilitates creating an `IndexedComponent` object which can handle multiple `ComponentData` objects which represent the component at each point in the indexing set. This makes it easier to build an instance of the model at each indexed point. However, State Blocks are slightly different, as they are always indexed (at least by time). Due to this, we often want to perform actions on all the elements of the indexed `StateBlock` all at once (rather than element by element), such as initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `_StateBlock` is defined without the `declare_process_block_data` decorator and thus works as a traditional class and this facilitates performing a method on the class as a whole rather than individual elements of the indexed property blocks. In this class we define the initialization routine and release_state function. Initialization is of extreme importance when it comes to non-linear programs like the one, we have on our hands. The initialization function takes initial guesses for the state variables chosen as an argument `state_args`. This has the following inputs for this unit model, initial guesses for the following state variables, flow_mol_comp, temperature, pressure. This also takes a boolean argument for if the state variable is fixed or not in `state_vars_fixed`. If `state_vars_fixed` is `True` then the initialization routine will not deal with fixing and unfixing variables. `hold_state` is a boolean argument that indicates if the state variables should be unfixed during initialization. If this argument is `False` then no state variables are fixed, else the state variables are fixed, and it returns a dictionary with flags for the state variables indicating which are fixed during the initialization. `outlvl` is an output level of logging. The other 2 arguments are `solver` and `optarg` which are the solver and solver options respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look further into the initialization routine, we see that we write a logger. This helps debug the property package. The next step is to check for the state variables if they are fixed or not. If the state variables are not fixed then we fix them using `fix_state_vars` function and if they are fixed we check the degrees of freedom (dof) for the initialization routine. We need to have dof be 0 for the initialization routine and if the dof is not 0, we raise exception. The next step in the initialization routine will be to take into account the `hold_state` argument. This argument will only make sense if the `fix_state_vars` argument is `False`. We check for the same and return the flags for the states if `hold_state` is `True`, else the state is released using `release_state` function. This concludes the initialization routine, and we log that the initialization routine is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "`release_states` function is to used to free the state variable from the current state. It takes flags as the argument which determine if the state is to held or can be released from initialize function. This function uses `revert_state_vars` function which reverts the fixed state of the state variables within an IDAES StateBlock based on a set of flags of the previous state. After releasing the state variables, completion of state release is logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two functions comprise of the `_StateBlock`, next we shall see the construction of the `OrgPhaseStateBlockData` class."

We'll commence with an overview, importing the required libraries, followed by the creation of the physical property block and two state blocks. The distinctions in this package lie in the physical parameter values, and notably, the absence of the diffusion factor term, differentiating it from the prior package. The following code snippet should provide clarity on these distinctions."

    "### Building the model\n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing the `LiqExtractionData` block and defining the config arguments for the control block, the next step is to write a build function that incorporates control volume and establishes constraints on the control volume to achieve the desired mass transfer. The control volume serves as a pivotal component in the unit model construction, representing the volume in which the process unfolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDAES provides flexibility in choosing control volumes based on geometry, with options including 0D or 1D. In this instance, we opt for a 0D control volume, the most commonly used control volume. This choice is suitable for systems where there is a well-mixed volume of fluid or where spatial variations are deemed negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The control volume encompasses parameters from (1-8), and its equations are configured to satisfy the specified config arguments. For a more in-depth understanding, users are encouraged to refer to [this resource](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/2f34dd3abc1bce5ba17c80939a01f9034e4fbeef/docs/reference_guides/core/control_volume_0d.rst). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `build` function is initiated using the `super` function to gain access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class, in this case, the `LiqExtractionData` class. Following the `super` function, checks are performed on the property packages to ensure the appropriate names for the solvents, such as 'Aq' for the aqueous phase and 'Org' for the Organic phase. An error is raised if these conditions are not met. Subsequently, a check is performed to ensure there is at least one common component between the two property packages that can be transferred from one phase to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these checks are completed without any exceptions raised, it is ensured that the property packages have the desired components with appropriate names. The next step is to create a control volume and assign it to a property package. Here, we initiate with the Organic phase and attach a 0D control volume to it. The control volume takes arguments about the dynamics of the block, and the property package, along with property package arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent steps involve adding inlet and outlet state blocks to the control volume using the `add_state_blocks` function. This function takes arguments about the flow direction (defaulted to forward) and a flag for `has_phase_equilibrium`, which is read from the config. The control volume is now equipped with the inlet and outlet state blocks and has access to the Organic property package\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, material balance equations are added to the control volume using the `add_material_balance` function, taking into account the type of material balance,  `has_phase_equilibrium`, and the presence of `has_mass_transfer`. To understand this arguments further let us have a look at the material balance equation and how it is implemented in control volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial M_{t, p, j}}{\\partial t} = F_{in, t, p, j} - F_{out, t, p, j} + N_{kinetic, t, p, j} + N_{equilibrium, t, p, j} + N_{pe, t, p, j} + N_{transfer, t, p, j} + N_{custom, t, p, j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we shall see that $N_{transfer, t, p, j}$ is the term in the equation which is reponsible for the mass transfer and the `mass_transfer_term` should only be equal to the amount being transferred and not include a material balance on our own. For a detailed description of the terms one should refer to the following [resource](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/2f34dd3abc1bce5ba17c80939a01f9034e4fbeef/docs/reference_guides/core/control_volume_0d.rst)\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the creation of organic phase control volume. Similar procedure is done for the aqueous phase control volume with aqueous property package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the unit model has two control volumes with appropriate configurations and material, momentum and energy balances. The next step is to check the basis of the two property packages. They should both have the same flow basis, and an error is raised if this is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, the `add_inlet_ports` and `add_outlet_ports` functions are used to create inlet and outlet ports. These ports are named and assigned to each control volume, resulting in labeled inlet and outlet ports for each control volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent steps involve writing unit-level constraints. A check if the basis is either molar or mass, and unit-level constraints are written accordingly. The first constraint pertains to the mass transfer term for the aqueous phase. The mass transfer term is equal to $mass\\_transfer\\_term_{aq} = (D_{i})\\frac{mass_{i}~in~aq~phase}{flowrate~of~aq~phase}$. The second constraint relates to the mass transfer term in the organic phase, which is the negative of the mass transfer term in the aqueous phase: $mass\\_transfer\\_term_{org} = - mass\\_transfer\\_term_{aq} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This marks the completion of the build function, and the unit model is now equipped with the necessary process constraints. The subsequent steps involve writing the initialization routine."

    "### Initialization Routine\n",
    "\n",
    "After writing the unit model it is crucial to initialize the model properly, as non-linear models may encounter local minima or infeasibility if not initialized properly. IDAES provides us with a few initialization routines which may not work for all the models, and in such cases the developer will have to define their own initialization routines. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom initialization routine, model developers must create an initialize method as part of their model, and provide a sequence of steps intended to build up a feasible solution. Initialization routines generally make use of Pyomo’s tools for activating and deactivating constraints and often involve solving multiple sub-problems whilst building up an initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we would use the pre-defined initialization routine of `BlockTriangularizationInitializer` when initializing the model in the flowsheet. This Initializer should be suitable for most models, but may struggle to initialize\n",
    "tightly coupled systems of equations. This method of initialization will follow the following workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Have precheck for structural singularity\n",
    "- Run incidence analysis on given block data and check matching.\n",
    "- Call Block Triangularization solver on model.\n",
    "- Call solve_strongly_connected_components on a given BlockData.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about this initialization routine can be found [here](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/c09433b9afed5ae2fe25c0ccdc732783324f0101/idaes/core/initialization/block_triangularization.py). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This marks the conclusion of creating a custom unit model, for a more detailed explanation on creating a unit model refer [this resource](../../unit_models/custom_unit_models/custom_compressor.ipynb). The next sections will deal with the diagonistics and testing of the property package and unit model. "

    "1. `Unit tests`: Test runs quickly (under 2 seconds) and has no network/system dependencies. Uses only libraries installed by default with the software\n",
    "2. `Component test`: Test may run more slowly (under 10 seconds, or so), e.g. it may run a solver or create a bunch of files. Like unit tests, it still shouldn't depend on special libraries or dependencies.\n",
    "3. `Integration test`: Test may take a long time to run, and may have complex dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation is that unit tests should be run by developers rather frequently, component tests should be run by the continuous integration system before running code, and integration tests are run across the codebase regularly, but infrequently (e.g. daily).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a developer, testing is a crucial aspect of ensuring the reliability and correctness of the unit model. The testing process involves both Unit tests and Component tests, and pytest is used as the testing framework. A typical test is marked with @pytest.mark.level, where the level indicates the depth or specificity of the testing. This is written in a file usually named as test_*.py or *_test.py. The test files have functions written in them with the appropriate lavel of test being conducted.  \n",

    "For more detailed information on testing methodologies and procedures, developers are encouraged to refer to [this resource](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference_guides/developer/testing.html).

    "\n",
    "During the component tests, we evaluate the performance of the unit model when integrated with the property package. This evaluation process typically involves several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unit Consistency Check: Verify that the unit model maintains consistency in its units throughout the model. This ensures that all variables and constraints within the model adhere to the same unit system, guaranteeing compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Termination Condition Verification: This involves checking whether the model terminates optimally with the given inlet conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variable Value Assessment: Check the values of outlet variables against the expected values. To account for the numerical tolerance of the solvers, the values are compared using the approx function with a relative tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Input Variable Stability Test: Verify that input variables, which should remain fixed during model operation, are not inadvertently unfixed or altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Structural Issues: Verify that there are no structural issues with the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "By performing these checks, we conclude the testing for the unit model. "
