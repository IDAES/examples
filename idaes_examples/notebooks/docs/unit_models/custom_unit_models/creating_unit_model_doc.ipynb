    "# Creating Custom Unit Model\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a comprehensive step-wise procedure to build a custom unit model from scratch. This tutorial will include creating a property package, a custom unit model and testing them. For this tutorial we shall create a custom unit model for Liquid - Liquid Extraction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Liquid - Liquid Extractor model contains two immiscible fluids forming the two phases. One of the phases, say phase_1 has a high concentration of solutes which is to be separated. A mass transfer happens between the two phases and the solute is transferred from phase_1 to phase_2. This mass transfer is governed by a parameter called the distribution coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing the working principles of the Liquid - Liquid Extractor, we shall proceed to create a custom unit model. We will require a property package for each phase, a custom unit model class and tests for the model and property packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before commencing the development of the model, we need to state some assumptions which the following unit model will be using. \n",
    "- Steady-state only\n",
    "- Organic phase property package has a single phase named Org\n",
    "- Aqueous phase property package has a single phase named Aq\n",
    "- Organic and Aqueous phase properties need not have the same component list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus as per the assumptions, we will be creating one property package for the aqueous phase (Aq), and the other for the Organic phase (Org). "

    "# 1.2 Physical Parameter Data Block\n",
    "\n",
    "A `PhysicalParameterBlock` serves as the central point of reference for all aspects of the property package and needs to define several things about the package. These are summarized below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Units of measurement\n",
    "- What properties are supported and how they are implemented\n",
    "- What components and phases are included in the packages\n",
    "- All the global parameters necessary for calculating properties\n",
    "- A reference to the associated State Block class, so that construction of the State Block components can be automated from the Physical Parameter Block\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct this block, we begin by declaring a process block class using a Python decorator. One can learn more about `declare_process_block_class` [here](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/eea1209077b75f7d940d8958362e69d4650c079d/idaes/core/base/process_block.py#L173). After constructing the process block, we define a build function which contains all the components that the property package would have. `super` function here is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class and since this is used on the class `PhysicalParameterData` class, build has access to all the parent and sibling class methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `PhysicalParameterBlock` then refers to the `state block`, in this case `OrgPhaseStateBlock` (which will be declared later), so that we can build a state block instance by only knowing the `PhysicalParameterBlock` we wish to use. Then we move on to list the number of phases in this property package. Then we assign the variable to the phase which follows a naming convention. Like here since the solvent is in the Organic phase, we will assign the Phase as OrganicPhase and the variable will be named Org as per the naming convention. The details of naming conventions can be found [here](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/main/docs/explanations/conventions.rst). We will be following the same convention throughout the example. \n",
    " \n",
    "After defining the list of the phases, we move on to list the components and their type in the phase. It can be a solute or a solvent in the Organic phase. Thus, we define the component and assign it to either being a solute or a solvent. In this case, the salts are the solutes and Ethylene dibromide is the solvent. Next, we define the physical properties involved in the package, like the heat capacity and density of the solvent, the reference temperature, and the distribution factor that would govern the mass transfer from one phase into another. Additionally, a parameter, the `diffusion_factor`, is introduced. This factor plays a crucial role in governing mass transfer between phases, necessitating its definition within the state block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in creating the Physical Parameter Block is to declare a `classmethod` named `define_metadata`, which takes two arguments: a class (cls) and an instance of that class (obj). In this method, we will call the predefined method `add_default_units()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `obj.add_default_units()` sets the default units metadata for the property package, and here we define units to be used with this property package as default.  "

    "# 1.3 State Block\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `PhysicalParameterBlock` class has been created, the next step is to write the code necessary to create the State Blocks that will be used throughout the flowsheet. `StateBlock` contains all the information necessary to define the state of the system. This includes the state variables and constraints on those variables which are used to describe a state property like the enthalpy, material balance, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a State Block requires us to write two classes. The reason we write two classes is because of the inherent nature of how `declare_process_block_data` works. `declare_process_block_data` facilitates creating an `IndexedComponent` object which can handle multiple `ComponentData` objects which represent the component at each point in the indexing set. This makes it easier to build an instance of the model at each indexed point. However, State Blocks are slightly different, as they are always indexed (at least by time). Due to this, we often want to perform actions on all the elements of the indexed StateBlock all at once (rather than element by element).\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `_OrganicStateBlock` is defined without the `declare_process_block_data` decorator and thus works as a traditional class and this facilitates performing a method on the class as a whole rather than individual elements of the indexed property blocks. In this class we define the `fix_initialization_states` function. `fix_initialization_states` function is to used to fix the state variable within the state block with the provided initial values (usually inlet conditions). It takes a `block` as the argument in which the state variables are to be fixed. It also takes `state_args` as an optional argument. `state_args` is a dictionary with the value for the state variables to be fixed. This function returns a dictionary indexed by the block, state variables and variable index indicating the fixed status of each variable before applying the function. \n",

    "### Building the model\n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing the `LiqExtractionData` block and defining the config arguments for the control block, the next step is to write a build function that incorporates control volume and establishes constraints on the control volume to achieve the desired mass transfer. The control volume serves as a pivotal component in the unit model construction, representing the volume in which the process unfolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDAES provides flexibility in choosing control volumes based on geometry, with options including 0D or 1D. In this instance, we opt for a 0D control volume, the most commonly used control volume. This choice is suitable for systems where there is a well-mixed volume of fluid or where spatial variations are deemed negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The control volume encompasses parameters from (1-8), and its equations are configured to satisfy the specified config arguments. For a more in-depth understanding, users are encouraged to refer to [this resource](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/2f34dd3abc1bce5ba17c80939a01f9034e4fbeef/docs/reference_guides/core/control_volume_0d.rst). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `build` function is initiated using the `super` function to gain access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class, in this case, the `LiqExtractionData` class. Following the `super` function, checks are performed on the property packages to ensure the appropriate names for the solvents, such as 'Aq' for the aqueous phase and 'Org' for the Organic phase. An error is raised if these conditions are not met. Subsequently, a check is performed to ensure there is at least one common component between the two property packages that can be transferred from one phase to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these checks are completed without any exceptions raised, it is ensured that the property packages have the desired components with appropriate names. The next step is to create a control volume and assign it to a property package. Here, we initiate with the Organic phase and attach a 0D control volume to it. The control volume takes arguments about the dynamics of the block, and the property package, along with property package arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent steps involve adding inlet and outlet state blocks to the control volume using the `add_state_blocks` function. This function takes arguments about the flow direction (defaulted to forward) and a flag for `has_phase_equilibrium`, which is read from the config. The control volume is now equipped with the inlet and outlet state blocks and has access to the Organic property package\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, material balance equations are added to the control volume using the `add_material_balance` function, taking into account the type of material balance,  `has_phase_equilibrium`, and the presence of `has_mass_transfer`.

    "Here we shall see that $N_{transfer, t, p, j}$ is the term in the equation which is responsible for the mass transfer and the `mass_transfer_term` should only be equal to the amount being transferred and not include a material balance on our own. For a detailed description of the terms one should refer to the following [resource](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/2f34dd3abc1bce5ba17c80939a01f9034e4fbeef/docs/reference_guides/core/control_volume_0d.rst)\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the creation of organic phase control volume. Similar procedure is done for the aqueous phase control volume with aqueous property package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the unit model has two control volumes with appropriate configurations and material, momentum and energy balances. The next step is to check the basis of the two property packages. They should both have the same flow basis, and an error is raised if this is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, the `add_inlet_ports` and `add_outlet_ports` functions are used to create inlet and outlet ports. These ports are named and assigned to each control volume, resulting in labeled inlet and outlet ports for each control volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent steps involve writing unit-level constraints. A check if the basis is either molar or mass, and unit-level constraints are written accordingly. The first constraint pertains to the mass transfer term for the aqueous phase. The mass transfer term is equal to $mass\\_transfer\\_term_{aq} = (D_{i})\\frac{mass_{i}~in~aq~phase}{flowrate~of~aq~phase}$. The second constraint relates to the mass transfer term in the organic phase, which is the negative of the mass transfer term in the aqueous phase: $mass\\_transfer\\_term_{org} = - mass\\_transfer\\_term_{aq} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $mass\\_transfer\\_term_{p}$ is the term indicating the amount of material being transferred from/to the phase and $D_{i}$ is the Distribution co-efficient for component i. \n",

    "This marks the completion of the build function, and the unit model is now equipped with the necessary process constraints. The subsequent steps involve writing the initialization routine."

    "\n",
    "Testing is a crucial part of model development to ensure that the model works as expected, and remains reliable. Here's an overview of why we conduct testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Verify Correctness`: Testing ensure that the model works as expected and meets the specified requirements. \n",
    "2. `Detect Bugs and Issues`: Testing helps in identifying bugs, errors, or unexpected behaviors in the code or model, allowing for timely fixes.\n",
    "3. `Ensure Reliability`: Testing improves the reliability and robustness of the software, reducing the risk of failures when the user uses it.\n",
    "4. `Support Changes`: Tests provide confidence when making changes or adding new features, ensuring that existing functionalities are not affected and work as they should.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically 3 types of tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Unit tests`: Test runs quickly (under 2 seconds) and has no network/system dependencies. Uses only libraries installed by default with the software\n",
    "2. `Component test`: Test may run more slowly (under 10 seconds, or so), e.g. it may run a solver or create a bunch of files. Like unit tests, it still shouldn't depend on special libraries or dependencies.\n",
    "3. `Integration test`: Test may take a long time to run, and may have complex dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation is that unit tests should be run by developers rather frequently, component tests should be run by the continuous integration system before running code, and integration tests are run across the codebase regularly, but infrequently (e.g. daily).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a developer, testing is a crucial aspect of ensuring the reliability and correctness of the unit model. The testing process involves both Unit tests and Component tests, and pytest is used as the testing framework. A typical test is marked with @pytest.mark.level, where the level indicates the depth or specificity of the testing. This is written in a file usually named as test_*.py or *_test.py. The test files have functions written in them with the appropriate level of test being conducted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information on testing methodologies and procedures, developers are encouraged to refer to [this resource](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference_guides/developer/testing.html).
