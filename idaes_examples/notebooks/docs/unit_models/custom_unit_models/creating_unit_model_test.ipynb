        "The Liquid - Liquid Extractor model contains two immiscible fluids forming the two phases. One of the phases, say phase_1 has a high concentration of solutes which is to be separated.

        "\n",
        "A `PhysicalParameterBlock` serves as the central point of reference for all aspects of the property package and needs to define several things about the package. These are summarized below:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Units of measurement\n",
        "- What properties are supported and how they are implemented\n",
        "- What components and phases are included in the packages\n",
        "- All the global parameters necessary for calculating properties\n",
        "- A reference to the associated State Block class, so that construction of the State Block components can be automated from the Physical Parameter Block\n",
        "\n",
        "To construct this block, we begin by declaring a process block class using a Python decorator. One can learn more about `declare_process_block_class` [here](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/eea1209077b75f7d940d8958362e69d4650c079d/idaes/core/base/process_block.py#L173). After constructing the process block, we define a build function which contains all the components that the property package would have. `super` function here is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class and since this is used on the class `PhysicalParameterData` class, build has access to all the parent and sibling class methods. \n",
        "\n",
        "The `PhysicalParameterBlock` then refers to the `state block`, in this case `OrgPhaseStateBlock` (which will be declared later), so that we can build a state block instance by only knowing the `PhysicalParameterBlock` we wish to use. Then we move on to list the number of phases in this property package. Then we assign the variable to the phase which follows a naming convention. Like here since the solvent is in the Organic phase, we will assign the Phase as OrganicPhase and the variable will be named Org as per the naming convention. The details of naming conventions can be found [here](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/main/docs/explanations/conventions.rst). We will be following the same convention throughout the example. \n",
        " \n",
        "After defining the list of the phases, we move on to list the components and their type in the phase. It can be a solute or a solvent in the Organic phase. Thus, we define the component and assign it to either being a solute or a solvent. In this case, the salts are the solutes and Ethylene dibromide is the solvent. Next, we define the physical properties involved in the package, like the heat capacity and density of the solvent, the reference temperature, and the distribution factor that would govern the mass transfer from one phase into another. Additionally, a parameter, the `diffusion_factor`, is introduced. This factor plays a crucial role in governing mass transfer between phases, necessitating its definition within the state block.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final step in creating the Physical Parameter Block is to declare a `classmethod` named `define_metadata`, which takes two arguments: a class (cls) and an instance of that class (obj). In this method, we will call the predefined method `add_default_units()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `obj.add_default_units()` sets the default units metadata for the property package, and here we define units to be used with this property package as default.  "

This includes the state variables and constraints on those variables which are used to describe a state property like the enthalpy, material balance, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a State Block requires us to write two classes. The reason we write two classes is because of the inherent nature of how `declare_process_block_data` works. `declare_process_block_data` facilitates creating an `IndexedComponent` object which can handle multiple `ComponentData` objects which represent the component at each point in the indexing set. This makes it easier to build an instance of the model at each indexed point. However, State Blocks are slightly different, as they are always indexed (at least by time). Due to this, we often want to perform actions on all the elements of the indexed StateBlock all at once (rather than element by element).\n",

        "The class `_OrganicStateBlock` is defined without the `declare_process_block_data` decorator and thus works as a traditional class and this facilitates performing a method on the class as a whole rather than individual elements of the indexed property blocks. In this class we define the `fix_initialization_states` function. `fix_initialization_states` function is to used to fix the state variable within the state block with the provided initial values (usually inlet conditions). It takes a `block` as the argument in which the state variables are to be fixed. It also takes `state_args` as an optional argument. `state_args` is a dictionary with the value for the state variables to be fixed. This function returns a dictionary indexed by the block, state variables and variable index indicating the fixed status of each variable before applying the function. \n",

We'll commence with an overview, importing the required libraries, followed by the creation of the physical property block and two state blocks. The distinctions in this package lie in the physical parameter values, and notably, the absence of the diffusion factor term, differentiating it from the prior package. The following code snippet should provide clarity on these distinctions."

        "After constructing the `LiqExtractionData` block and defining the config arguments for the control block, the next step is to write a build function that incorporates control volume and establishes constraints on the control volume to achieve the desired mass transfer. The control volume serves as a pivotal component in the unit model construction, representing the volume in which the process unfolds.\n",
        "\n",
        "IDAES provides flexibility in choosing control volumes based on geometry, with options including 0D or 1D. In this instance, we opt for a 0D control volume, the most commonly used control volume. This choice is suitable for systems where there is a well-mixed volume of fluid or where spatial variations are deemed negligible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The control volume encompasses parameters from (1-8), and its equations are configured to satisfy the specified config arguments. For a more in-depth understanding, users are encouraged to refer to [this resource](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/2f34dd3abc1bce5ba17c80939a01f9034e4fbeef/docs/reference_guides/core/control_volume_0d.rst). \n",
        "\n",
        "The `build` function is initiated using the `super` function to gain access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class, in this case, the `LiqExtractionData` class. Following the `super` function, checks are performed on the property packages to ensure the appropriate names for the solvents, such as 'Aq' for the aqueous phase and 'Org' for the Organic phase. An error is raised if these conditions are not met. Subsequently, a check is performed to ensure there is at least one common component between the two property packages that can be transferred from one phase to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "After these checks are completed without any exceptions raised, it is ensured that the property packages have the desired components with appropriate names. The next step is to create a control volume and assign it to a property package. Here, we initiate with the Organic phase and attach a 0D control volume to it. The control volume takes arguments about the dynamics of the block, and the property package, along with property package arguments. \n",
        "\n",
        "The subsequent steps involve adding inlet and outlet state blocks to the control volume using the `add_state_blocks` function. This function takes arguments about the flow direction (defaulted to forward) and a flag for `has_phase_equilibrium`, which is read from the config. The control volume is now equipped with the inlet and outlet state blocks and has access to the Organic property package\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, material balance equations are added to the control volume using the `add_material_balance` function, taking into account the type of material balance,  `has_phase_equilibrium`, and the presence of `has_mass_transfer`. To understand this arguments further let us have a look at the material balance equation and how it is implemented in control volume. \n",

For a detailed description of the terms one should refer to the following [resource](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/blob/2f34dd3abc1bce5ba17c80939a01f9034e4fbeef/docs/reference_guides/core/control_volume_0d.rst)\n",

        "\n",
        "Following this, the `add_inlet_ports` and `add_outlet_ports` functions are used to create inlet and outlet ports. These ports are named and assigned to each control volume, resulting in labeled inlet and outlet ports for each control volume.\n",

        "The subsequent steps involve writing unit-level constraints. A check if the basis is either molar or mass, and unit-level constraints are written accordingly. The first constraint pertains to the mass transfer term for the aqueous phase. The mass transfer term is equal to $mass\\_transfer\\_term_{aq} = (D_{i})\\frac{mass_{i}~in~aq~phase}{flowrate~of~aq~phase}$. The second constraint relates to the mass transfer term in the organic phase, which is the negative of the mass transfer term in the aqueous phase: $mass\\_transfer\\_term_{org} = - mass\\_transfer\\_term_{aq} $\n",

        "1. Unit Consistency Check: Verify that the unit model maintains consistency in its units throughout the model. This ensures that all variables and constraints within the model adhere to the same unit system, guaranteeing compatibility.\n",

        "2. Termination Condition Verification: This involves checking whether the model terminates optimally with the given inlet conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Variable Value Assessment: Check the values of outlet variables against the expected values. To account for the numerical tolerance of the solvers, the values are compared using the approx function with a relative tolerance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Input Variable Stability Test: Verify that input variables, which should remain fixed during model operation, are not inadvertently unfixed or altered.\n",
