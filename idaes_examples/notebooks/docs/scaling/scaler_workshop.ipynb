    "# How to Create Scaler Objects in IDAES\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Andrew Lee\n",
    "Maintainer: Doug Allan\n",
    "Updated: 2024-10-24\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",
    "<b>NOTE</b> All the suggestions in this introduction should be viewed as \"rules-of-thumb\" and not taken as absolute guidance. There are many cases where alternative approaches may give as-good or better results and you should always consider the meaning of the scaling factors you are applying and how they affect the solver's behavior. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving general non-linear problems has always been challenging, and is highly dependent on how well scaled the model is. In many cases, as much time (or more) is spent trying to improve the model formulation and scaling as was spent writing the original model. To assist molders with this task, IDAES has implemented a Scaling Toolbox which contains a number of useful tools for common scaling techniques as well as a standard interface and form for how to write scaling routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this workshop is to take you through the process of writing a general-purpose, modular scaling routine for an equilibrium reactor example. By the end of this exercise you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand the ``CustomScalerBase`` class and how to apply the tools it contains,\n",
    "* understand how to use ``CustomScalerBase`` to set up a modular scaling routine for a model,\n",
    "* understand how to use the Diagnostics Toolbox to check for scaling issues in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Write a Scaling Routine\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> The golden rule when developing a scaling routine to a model is to always think about what you are doing and why. Bad scaling is often worse than no scaling at all, so assigning arbitrary scaling factors should be avoided. Always start by taking the time to look over the model you want to scale and understand what variables and constraints are present. For variables, you should ask yourself what the expected range of magnitudes will be; assigning an arbitrary default value should be avoided. For constraints you should ask yourself what the expected magnitude of each additive term will be, how much these vary from each other, and which term is likely to be most significant in terms of variation (partial derivatives). </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",
    "<b>NOTE</b> Different solvers behave in different ways, and you may find cases where tuning scaling for one solver results in worse performance for another.\n",
    "    \n",
    "You should always consider the end-goal when writing a Scaler; if you are writing a routine for a specific application and solver then you may wish to tune the scaling factors for best performance, however if you are writing a general-purpose Scaler then you should aim for scaling that will work for a wide range of conditions and solver.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some general suggestions for developing scaling routines.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Order of magnitude estimates are generally good enough (and often better than exact values).\n",
    "* Start with what you know the most about, and work out from there.\n",
    "* If in doubt, start by scaling variables first, and then scale constraints based on the variable scaling.\n",
    "* Be judicious when applying scaling factors for things you are uncertain about. If in doubt, leave a component unscaled and see what the model diagnostics have to say.\n",
    "* Make use of the modular nature of IDAES when writing scaling routines. A unit model developer might not know the expected magnitude of the thermophysical properties they get from a property package, but there should be a scaling routine for the property package that they can call to provide these.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",
    "<b>NOTE</b> When dealing with systems of partial differential algebraic equations (PDAEs), such as dynamic systems or those with spatial variation, it is important to consider how scaling may change across the discretized domain. In many of these types of models, you will find significant changes in scale across a small portion of the domain; for example a dynamic model of a step disturbance will show an initial equilibrium state followed by a rapid change in system conditions until a new equilibrium is established. To complicate things further, the location of this ramp can often move significantly with minor changes in system conditions, thus you should not presume that the ramp will remain in the same place.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As a general rule, for scaling PDAE systems with significant changes, you should focus on finding a set of scaling factors that is suitable for the ramp region as this is the part of the model which will be hardest to solve.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### IDAES Scaling Interface and Toolbox\n",
    "\n",
    "IDAES uses a class-based interface for defining scaling routines, where model developers can create ``Scaler`` objects which define a scaling routine suitable for a type of model or specific application. All models (both those in the IDAES model libraries and user-developed models) should have one or more ``Scaler`` classes defined for them that can be used to apply scaling routines to the model. To assist end-users in identifying a suitable ``Scaler`` for a model, all IDAES models have a ``default_scaler`` attribute which can be set to point to a ``Scaler`` object suitable for that model. Model developers should endeavor to create a reliable, general-purpose ``Scaler`` for each model they create and assign this as the default ``Scaler``. We will demonstrate how to do this at the end of this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Set Up Test Case(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst it is possible to develop a scaling routine by looking only at the model code and the resulting variables and constraints, in order to test it we will need one or more test cases to run. These test cases are important for both checking the that ``Scaler`` code runs as expected, and that it also improves the scaling of the model. The more test cases you can check against, the more confident you can be that the ``Scaler`` you have written is suitable for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we will develop a general purpose ``Scaler`` for the ``EquilibriumReactor`` model from the core IDAES model library using the saponification property and reaction packages as a test case. The code below imports the necessary packages and creates a function that will build and initialize our test case."

    "\n",
    "A bigger issue however is the fact that in our initial model we are feeding reactants in stoichiometric amounts (1:1) meaning that both reactant concentrations go to zero at equilibrium. This results in the Jacobian for the reaction rate constraint becoming singular; with `rate = K_rxn * [NaOH] * [EthylAcetate]` if both concentrations go to zero then the partial derivative of the reaction rate with respect to each concentration is also 0, and thus our solver has no idea of what direction to move when trying to converge the problem. Whilst scaling can help work around this, this is ultimately an indication that our problem is not well formulated. In practice, an Equilibrium reactor model is not well suited for systems involving irreversible rate-based reactions as it requires concentrations to be driven to zero, and is an especially poor choice for stoichiometric feeds."

    "Now that we have a test case (or multiple test cases), we can start planning out the new scaling routine. As our goal is to estimate scaling factors for as many of the variables and constraints in the model as possible, the first step is to understand what variables and constraints may be present in the model. Note that we need to be careful to check for all variables and constraints that may exist under different configuration options, and not just those that appear in the our test case(s).\n",

The most common examples of modular sub-models are the ``StateBlocks`` and ``ReactionBlocks`` created by the associated property packages; we know that these exist and we create these in our models, but we do not know what variables and constraints they may construct. On the other hand, we also have variables and constraints that we construct directly in our model. For the purposes of this we include those variables and constraints constructed by ``ControlVolumes`` as being directly construed; whilst the ``ControlVolume`` might automate the details for us, we directly call methods on the ``ControlVolume`` to create these variables and constraints and we know what they will be based on the instructions we give.\n",

    "These diagnostics can help give us an idea of what may be causing problems in our model. From the output above, we can see that the variables with large Jacobian norms (i.e., high sensitivities) are the outlet flow rate and temperature, as well as the rate-based extent of reaction. We can also see that the constraints with large Jacobian norms are the enthalpy balance and H20 material balance for the reactor. However, caution must be used when interpreting these in isolation, as understanding what these mean is often complicated and initial impressions may be misleading. To get a better picture of what is contributing to extreme Jacobian values you should make use of the tools in the diagnostics ``SVDToolbox``, however that is a topic for another example.\n",

Thus, it is important to compare the list of variables and constraints with large Jacobian norms and think about how those intersect.\n",

    "For the Equilibrium Reactor, we have three submodels to scale; inlet state, outlet state and reactions. As mentioned in the introduction, when developing scaling routines always start with the things you have the most information about. In this case, we likely know the most about the inlet state; either it is a defined feed state (like in our test case) or we have some idea of the state (and scaling) from propagating values from an upstream operation. So, to apply variable scaling to the inlet state we would do the following:\n",

    "Once we have an idea of scaling for the inlet we can use that information to try to estimate scaling for the outlet state. The default assumption is that the scaling of the outlet will be similar to that of the inlet, so the easy path is to copy scaling from the inlet state to the outlet. However, we know that something must change between inlet and outlet (as otherwise this unit operation is doing nothing) so we should always stop and think about whether we can try to estimate these changes. For example, in a pressure changer we know, or be able to estimate, the pressure change across the unit and thus be able to change the scaling of pressure between the inlet and outlet. However, keep in mind that over-scaling can make things worse so be judicious when deciding whether to adjust scaling based on estimates.\n",

    "In regards to this, Equilibrium Reactors are one of the more challenging units to scale, as it is very hard to know what the outlet flows and concentrations will be without knowing what the reactions are (and even if you know the reactions it is often hard to know the equilibrium state). In most cases, we have no reliable way to estimate the outlet flowrate and concentrations, so this is best left to the user to provide. In the case of temperature and pressure, whilst we may expect these to change but any change will generally be 1-2 orders of magnitude less than the inlet state and thus the overall scale of these will likely remain similar. Thus, for the Equilibrium Reactor it is probably sufficient to just scale the outlet state based on the inlet state.\n",

    "## Step 5: Apply Variable Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to look at scaling the variables and constraints that make up the unit model itself. From a conceptual standpoint, it is generally easiest to start with the variables as we generally have at least some idea of the magnitude of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the equilibrium reactor, we have the following variables we need to scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rate-based reaction extent and generation terms\n",
    "2. Equilibrium-based reaction extent and generation terms\n",
    "3. Inherent reaction extent and generation terms\n",
    "4. Phase equilibrium generation terms\n",
    "5. Energy balance heat term\n",
    "6. Energy balance heats of reaction\n",
    "7. Pressure drop\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these are hard to know a priori - anything related to a reaction is very hard to know without knowing the reaction behavior. Considering that the equilibrium reactor is modular, we have little to no way of knowing these in the general case (and even in the specific test case it is hard enough). We can assume that the reaction package will scale all of its variables (i.e., rate and equilibrium constants, and reaction rates), however it is hard to project these to unit model scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a CSTR we can say that ``extent = volume*rate`` and thus estimate scaling, but this does not work for equilibrium systems where 1) volume is undefined, 2) reaction rate at the outlet state is being driven to zero to satisfy equilibrium, and 3) extent is solved implicitly to satisfy the need for reaction rate to equal zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that a bad guess is often worse than no guess, we will not scale these right now - it is important to remember that our goal is to improve the overall scaling so if we do not know how to scale something it is generally best to leave it unscaled. We might come back to these later if necessary, but for now we will leave these either for the user to provide based on knowledge of their system, or for automated fill-in using some autoscaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the heat and deltaP terms, these are dependent on extensive variables in each case study and we have no way of knowing their exact values. However, we can probably take a good guess at order-of-magnitude using engineering knowledge; heat duties are generally approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the enthalpy flows,\n",
    "and pressure drops are generally on the order of 0.1 bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply scaling for the pressure drop term, we can make use of the ``scale_variable_by_units`` method in ``CustomScalerBase``. This method looks up the units of measurement for the variable, and then loops in the class attribute ``UNIT_SCALING_FACTORS`` dictionary to find an equivalent unit for the quantity of interest and an associated scaling factor. If a scaling factor is found, it is converted as necessary; e.g., in this case pressure is defined in ``Pa`` but we can set the default scaling factor in ``bar`` and it will be converted as appropriate. The code required to do this is below.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to note here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As we expect the pressure drop to be on the order of 0.1 bar, we need to set a scaling factor of 10 for quantities with units of pressure. Also note that the key ``\"Pressure Change\"`` is for documentation purposes only and is not actually used by the code (but must be there). \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",
    "<b>NOTE</b> We cannot distinguish between different quantities with the same apparent units (e.g., we cannot distinguish between an absolute pressure and a pressure change).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Note that scaling is applied to elements of indexed components and not to the indexed component as a whole, and thus we need to use a ``for`` loop to iterate over the time index. This is done to force modelers to consider how the scaling of a variable or constraint will vary over the indexed domain, and try to discourage automatically setting a single scaling factor for all points.\n",
    "3. Pressure change is a configuration argument in our unit model, and thus may not be present in all cases. Therefore, we need the ``hasattr`` check to see if we need to scale ``deltaP`` or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of the heat duty, we want to scale based on the incoming enthalpy flow which means we first need to get the expected magnitude of the enthalpy flow. For that, we can use the ``get_expression_nominal_values`` method in ``CustomScalerBase`` which uses an expression walker to go through an expression to return a list of the expected magnitude (or nominal value) of all additive terms in the expression based on the scaling factors for the variables involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get an expression for the enthalpy flow term using the ``get_enthalpy_flow_terms`` method from the associated ``StateBlock``. We should assume this expression might contain multiple terms, so we should sum all the values returned to get the overall magnitude of the enthalpy flow term. Once we have this, we can then get the scaling factor for the heat duty by ``sf = abs(1/(0.1*enthalpy_flow))`` - note that the tools insist on scaling factors being positive (for sanity) and thus we need the absolute value here in case enthalpy flow is negative (which is not uncommon for enthalpy). The code to do this is shown below.\n",

    "Our updates have resulted in scaling factors for ``heat`` and ``deltaP`` appearing in the scaling report which is good, but comparing the diagnostics from the previous step we can see that the Jacobian condition number has not changed. Does this mean we did something wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is no - when we add a scaling factor to a variable, wherever that variable appears in a constraint it is replaced with ``sf*v_scaled``. Given that ``v_scaled = v/sf``, this means that for variables which only appear linearly in constraints then the partial derivative with respect to the scaled variable does not change either; thus the Jacobian is unaffected by scaling only the linear variables. In the case of this example, it turns out that  almost all the variables appear linearly and thus we see no change in the Jacobian condition number.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",
    "<b>NOTE</b> It is important to note that partial scaling of a model (e.g., variables only) can often appear worse than that of the unscaled model. Generally, it is best to wait until you have scaled both variables and constraints to make a decision on whether your attempts at scaling have made the problem better or worse, and you should not be discouraged if things look worse while in an intermediate state.\n",

    "## Step 6: Apply Constraint Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have scaled all the variables that we can (for now at least), we can move on to scaling constraints. The advantage of scaling all the variables first means that now we have an idea of the expected magnitude for all terms in the constraints which we can use to estimate scaling factors. For the Equilibrium reactor model, we need to scale all the constraints in the control volume, as well as the unit level constraint equating all reaction rates to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches to estimating scaling for constraints, and different approaches are better suited to certain situations. ``CustomScalerBase`` contains a ``scale_constraint_by_nominal_value`` method which can be used to automatically implement a number of common approaches to save you the effort of having to manually implement these yourself. As of writing, the approaches (or schemes) supported are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  ``ConstraintScalingScheme.inverseMaximum`` - scale the constraint based on the term with the largest absolute expected magnitude. This is scheme is useful for cases where most terms have similar magnitudes and is a good initial point to start.\n",
    "2. ``ConstraintScalingScheme.inverseMinimum`` - scale the constraint based on the term with the smallest absolute expected magnitude. This scheme is similar to the inverse maximum scheme and is useful for cases where you have a constraint with a number of smaller terms mixed with a few larger terms, or cases where the smaller term is expected to be most significant. This scheme should be used carefully however as it can result in large scaling factors making convergence of larger terms difficult.\n",
    "3. ``ConstraintScalingScheme.harmonicMean`` - scale the constraint using the harmonic mean of the absolute expected magnitude of all terms (``sf = sum(1/abs(nominal value))``). This scheme is most useful when you have a constraint with terms with a mix of expected magnitudes where you need to find a balance between the large and small terms.\n",
    "4. ``ConstraintScalingScheme.inverseSum`` - scale the constraint using the sum of the absolute expected magnitudes of all terms. Situationally useful for cases with terms of mixed magnitudes.\n",
    "5. ``ConstraintScalingScheme.inverseRSS`` - scale the constraint using the root sum of squares of the absolute expected magnitudes of all terms. Situationally useful for cases with terms of mixed magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "``CustomScalerBase`` also contains a ``scale_constraint_by_nominal_derivative_norm`` method that can scale a constraint based on an estimate of the Jacobian norm associated with that constraint which can be useful for cases where you want to focus on the Jacobian scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",
    "<b>NOTE</b> The solver you intend to use may impact which approach provides the best scaling for a given model. For example, IPOPT has very good internal Jacobian scaling (when using the `gradient-based` scaling option), and thus benefits the most from focusing on scaling the constraint residual magnitudes as opposed to the Jacobian.\n",

    "From the results of ``check_scaling`` we can see that we now have scaling factors for almost all the variables and constraints in the model (the only exceptions being the reaction related variables we left unscaled earlier). More importantly, we can see that the Jacobian condition number is now down to ``7.2E4`` from the original ``1.5E12`` which is an impressive improvement (and for not a lot of effort on our part). We can also see that the numerical diagnostics are no longer reporting any variables or constraints with extreme Jacobians (there are 2 individual entries that are a bit large, but it appears they are not having a big impact on the condition number).\n",

Here we are using an equilibrium reactor to drive a rate-based reaction to completion, which necessitates that at least one reactant have a concentration of zero as well as the reaction rate for all reactions. Thus, for this case these are unavoidable. As mentioned earlier, we really should be asking whether an Equilibrium Reactor is well suited for the reaction model we have here, and a Stoichiometric Reactor would probably have been a better choice (or a better reaction package which use reversible reactions with equilibrium).\n",

    "We can see that our ``EquilibriumReactorScaling`` routine actually results in a lower Jacobian condition number than the ``AutoScaler`` approach, so that is a sign we are doing things right. It is not unusual to see that we can get better scaling with a manual, magnitude based approach than an autoscaler as the autoscaler focuses solely on the Jacobian and thus often over-scales the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we might be able to do better by using other constraint scaling schemes, but before we start experimenting we should stop and think about what sort of scaling might make sense for each constraint. We should always also keep in the back of our minds whether additional work is worth the effort, and if we risk over-tuning the scaling for the specific property package we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the model in this example is fairly simple and we do not have too many constraints to consider.  Firstly, we have the unit-level constraint that says that `rate_reaction == 0` for all rate-based reactions. When considering scaling of a constraint we should ignore any 0 terms, thus this constraint has only 1 term and so we should scale based on this. If we use the ``scale_constraint_by_nominal_value`` method for this it will ignore the zero for us, the scheme used does not actually matter as there is only one term to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have the balance equations which all have the form `0 == In - Out + Gen` - note the equilibrium reactor does not support dynamics so we don't need to think about that. Generation terms can vary a lot, but we basically have two possible cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. one term is negligible compared to the other 2, so we should scale based on one of the significant\n",
    "terms, or\n",
    "2. all three terms are of similar significance (e.g., inlet and gen are of similar scale and outlet\n",
    "is ~inletx2). Here we could scale based on the harmonic mean, by the maximum term is probably not bad either.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in short the maximum magnitude is probably the best general-purpose scale for these constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have stoichiometric constraints with the form `G[j, r] == n[j, r]*X[r]` where ``G`` is generation, ``X`` is extent and ``n`` is the stoichiometric coefficient (i.e., a constant) - these are simple ``A=B`` constraints, so scaling by maximum magnitude is equivalent to other methods (as there are only two terms which will take the same value, all schemes will give the same result in the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for the equilibrium reactor at least, we are probably best leaving things as they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is one important test left. The whole purpose of a scaling routine is to allow us to perturb the model and solve it at the new state so we should test to confirm that our new ``Scaler`` has improved the performance of our solver when solving for the perturbed state we tried earlier. This also lets us see how the new ``Scaler`` will look for a user trying to apply the tool, which we can see below."

    "We can see that by applying our new ``EquilibriumReactorScaler`` we are now able to use IPOPT to solve for the perturbation, and that it reaches an optimal solution in 11 iterations. Looking at the solver logs we can see that the solver step lengths (``alpha_du`` and ``alpha_pr``) are rather small for the first iterations but the number of line searches (``ls``) is 1 for all iterations. This indicates that IPOPT is pushing up against some bound or constraint and cannot make full steps, but in this case it is due to the fact that to achieve equilibrium for an irreversible reaction at least one concentration must be driven to zero (and is why an EquibriumReactor is probably not a good choice for this test case). However, the fact that our ``Scaler`` let us solve for this challenging test case is probably a good sign.\n",
