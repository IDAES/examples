In this tutorial, we don't want to worry too much about the details that go into constructing the model.

This is a gas-solid reactor with counter-current flow. The degrees of freedom are gas and solid inlet flow rates, and we are trying to minimize the deviation from a desired operating point via a least-squares objective function.\n",

A telltale sign that something is wrong with our model is the persistence of regularization coefficients, that is, numbers in the `lg(rg)` column of the IPOPT log. These coefficients can have multiple causes. One is that the constraint Jacobian (partial derivative matrix) is singular, which indicates a problem with our model. We have set the `print_info_string` option in Ipopt to display \"diagnostic tags\" to help interpret these regularization coefficients. The \"L\" and \"l\" diagnostic tags, which appear repeatedly, indicate that the Jacobian is singular.

    "## Over and under-constrained subsystems\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural singularities are characterized by the [Dulmage-Mendelson decomposition][3], which partitions a system into minimal over and under-constrained subsystems. These subsystems contain the potentially unmatched constraints and variables, respectively. Here, \"unmatched\" effectively means \"causing a singularity\". [Pothen and Fan][4] give a good overview of the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition and [Parker et al.][5] give several examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "[3]: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-mathematics/article/coverings-of-bipartite-graphs/413735C5888AB542B92D0C4F402800B1\n",

    "The most straightforward way to fix a structural singularity is to fix variables that are in the under-constrained system and deactivate constraints in the over-constrained subsystem. However, this may not be applicable for every model. For example, we may need to add variables and constraints instead. What over and under-constrained subsystems are telling us is that something is wrong with our modeling assumptions. The particular fix that is appropriate will depend heavily on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above output gives us any clues, we can go ahead and start trying to fix things. However, suppose it doesn't. A good strategy is to try to break down the model into smaller, square subsystems that we think should be nonsingular. For a dynamic model like this one, a good candidate is the subsystem of variables and equations at each point in time."

While the name of these constraints implies they \"calculate holdups,\" material holdups at $t=0$ are fixed as initial conditions (because holdups are the differential variables with respect to time in this model). At other time points, we assume that holdups are specified by differential and discretization equations of the model. This means that the `material_holdup_calculation` constraints actually calculate the solid phase mass fractions *from* the holdups. But as we hinted at above, the 4-by-4 system of holdup calculation constraints, `sum_component_eqn` (which simply constrains the sum of mass fractions to be one), mass fractions, and `dens_mass_particle`, uniquely solve for `dens_mass_particle` *as well as* the mass fractions. But if the holdup variables can be used to solve for the mass fractions, they *also* solve  for `dens_mass_skeletal`. So both sides of `density_particle_constraint` are already uniquely determined!

With this in mind, we actually have several options for how to resolve this overspecification:\n",

We've chosen option 3, meaning we assume that the particle \"evolves\" with a density that is well determined from its constituent species, rather than changing density to accommodate whatever mass it accumulates via reaction without altering its volume. This exercise should remind us that all mathematical modeling is somewhat of an art. In the process of choosing the \"least bad\" model, it is fairly easy to over or under-specify something by making the wrong combination of assumptions, and the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition is a great tool for detecting when this has happened.\n",

    "What have we learned?\n",
    "1. IPOPT using non-zero regularization coefficients hints at a singular Jacobian (especially when \"L\"/\"l\" diagnostic tags are present).\n",
    "2. When this happens, start by calling `report_structural_issues` to check for a structural singularity. If this looks good, call `report_numerical_issues` to check for a numerical singularity.\n",
    "3. When debugging a structural singularity, decomposing a problem into subsystems that each should be nonsingular (e.g. unit models or points in time) is very useful.\n",
    "4. The solution to a structural singularity is often to relax a fixed parameter, add a constraint that was forgotten, remove a constraint that was redundant, or fix an extraneous degree of freedom.\n",
    "5. Model-specific intuition is usually necessary to diagnose and fix modeling issues. (If you're an algorithm developer, learn about the models you're using! If you don't understand your models, you don't understand your algorithms!)\n",
    "6. A modeling issue doesn't necessarily have a unique solution. This is especially true when the issue involves invalid assumptions.\n",
    "7. Debugging is an iterative process &mdash; fixing one issue can introduce another."
