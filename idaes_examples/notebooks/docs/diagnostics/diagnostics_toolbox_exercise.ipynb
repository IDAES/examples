        "# IDAES Model Diagnostics Toolbox Tutorial\n",

        "As you have likely discovered already, developing and solving models in an equation-oriented (EO) environment can be challenging and often takes a significant amount of effort. There are many pitfalls and mistakes that can be encountered when developing a model which can greatly impact the solvability and robustness of the final problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model diagnosis and debugging is often more of an art than a science, and it generally relies on significant experience and understanding both of general EO modeling techniques and the specific model and problem being solved. To assist with this process, IDAES has developed a model diagnostics toolbox that brings together a large number of tools for identifying potential issues in a model to help guide the user through the process of finding and resolving these issues. Note however that whilst these tools can help identify the presence of an issue, remedying the issue always requires some degree of engineering knowledge about the system being modeled, and thus it is ultimately up to the user to find a solution to the problem.\n",
        "\n",

The size of the model is often important for judging how difficult it will be to solve, and this information can also be useful for comparison to what is being sent to the solver. Most solvers will report the size of the model in their output logs, and if there is a difference between what is reported here and by the solver, then you should probably look into what is happening. This section also notes some things such as if you have any deactivated Blocks, Constraints or Objectives, or if you have variables which appear in the constraints that are not part of the model; these are not necessarily wrong but it is easy to have accidentally deactivated something you did not intend to so you should always check to see that these are expected.\n",

Cautions represent issues that may or may not be problematic; in many cases these might be expected behaviors or borderline issues. However, these could also represent conceptual issues that should be addressed, so users should take the time to investigate these and determine if they need to be fixed or not.\n",

If any warnings were identified, this section will list methods that can help you get more information on each specific problem, and if no warnings are found then it will guide you onto the next step in the model diagnosis workflow.\n",
