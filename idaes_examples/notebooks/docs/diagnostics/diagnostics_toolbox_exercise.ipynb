    "# IDAES Model Diagnostics Toolbox Tutorial\n",
    "Author: Andrew Lee  \n",

    "Updated: 2023-10-31  \n",
    "\n",
    "As you have likely discovered already, developing and solving models in an equation-oriented (EO) environment can be challenging and often takes a significant amount of effort. There are many pitfalls and mistakes that can be encountered when developing a model which can greatly impact the solvability and robustness of the final problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model diagnosis and debugging is often more of an art than a science, and it generally relies on significant experience and understanding both of general EO modeling techniques and the specific model and problem being solved. To assist with this process, IDAES has developed a model diagnostics toolbox that brings together a large number of tools for identifying potential issues in a model to help guide the user through the process of finding and resolving these issues. Note however that whilst these tools can help identify the presence of an issue, remedying the issue always requires some degree of engineering knowledge about the system being modeled, and thus it is ultimately up to the user to find a solution to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will take you through using the {py:class}`DiagnosticsToolbox <idaes.core.util.model_diagnostics.DiagnosticsToolbox>` to debug a number of issues in a simple Pyomo model and to take it from initially reporting a possible infeasible solution to returning the correct solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Firstly, we need a model to test (and, for this tutorial at least, one that has a wide range of issues that we need to fix before it will solve). We then also need to fix some variables so that we have 0 degrees of freedom in our model. Whilst our ultimate goal is generally optimization (and thus a system with 1 or more degrees of freedom), all models conceptually derive from a square model representing a nominal state. If this nominal state is not well-posed, then any issues present will also be present in the resulting optimization (even if adding degrees of freedom means that the model is now easier to solve).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The first section is a summary of the size of the model, indicating things like the number of variables and constraints. The size of the model is often important for judging how difficult it will be to solve, and this information can also be useful for comparison to what is being sent to the solver. Most solvers will report the size of the model in their output logs, and if there is a difference between what is reported here and by the solver, then you should probably look into what is happening. This section also notes some things such as if you have any deactivated Blocks, Constraints or Objectives, or if you have variables which appear in the constraints that are not part of the model; these are not necessarily wrong but it is easy to have accidentally deactivated something you did not intend to so you should always check to see that these are expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second section provides a summary of any critical structural issues that were found - in this case we can see that there are 2 warnings we are going to need to look into. Warnings represent issues that need to be addressed before moving on as these will likely cause the solver to fail or give an incorrect answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third section lists a summary of any cautions that are found. Cautions represent issues that may or may not be problematic; in many cases these might be expected behaviors or borderline issues. However, these could also represent conceptual issues that should be addressed, so users should take the time to investigate these and determine if they need to be fixed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, there is a section that suggests the next steps to take to help guide you through the model diagnosis process. If any warnings were identified, this section will list methods that can help you get more information on each specific problem, and if no warnings are found then it will guide you onto the next step in the model diagnosis workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** there are methods available to help investigate cautions as well, but these will not show up in the next steps in order to avoid cluttering the output. You can get more information on the available methods for investigating cautions via the documentation or ``help()`` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our current model, we have 2 critical issues (warnings) that we need to look into and resolve. The order in which we resolve these will generally not matter, but be aware that these can often be interrelated - fixing one warning might resolve other warnings as well (or create new ones), and sometimes you will need to look at multiple issues together to find the overall root cause.\n",

Whilst we were able to solve the unscaled model in this case, this is in part because it was a simple linear model.

That is, you can often find cases where the unscaled (or poorly scaled) model solves for a limited range of conditions but fails to solve if you move too far away for the current state.
