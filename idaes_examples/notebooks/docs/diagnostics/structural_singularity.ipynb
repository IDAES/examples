A telltale sign that something is wrong with our model is the persistence of regularization coefficients, that is, numbers in the `lg(rg)` column. These coefficients can have multiple causes. One is that the Hessian of the Lagrangian (after barrier correction) is not positive definite. Another is that the equality constraint Jacobian is not full row rank. We have set the `print_info_string` option in Ipopt to display \"diagnostic tags\" to help interpret these regularization coefficients. The \"L\" diagnostic tag, which appears repeatedly, indicates that the Jacobian is row rank-deficient.
