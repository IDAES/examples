        "<b>Note:</b>\n",
        "Degeneracy Hunter requires a suitable MILP solver. This example uses the open-source solver SCIP (https://scipopt.org/), however users may specify another solver of their choice if they have one available.\n",

        "## What does Degeneracy Mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple terms, a degenerate model contains one or more constraints that do not add any additional information that is not already included in other constraints in the model. The simplest example of this is the case where a constraint in the model is duplicated. For example, consider the model below:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
        "& x_1 + x_2 = 1 \\\\\n",
        "& x_1 + x_2 = 1 \\\\\n",
        "\\end{align*} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice the two equality constraints are identical and thus redundant. This means the constraint qualifications that solvers rely on (e.g., [Linear Independence Constraint Qualification or LICQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions#Regularity_conditions_(or_constraint_qualifications))) do not hold which has three important implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The optimal solution may not be mathematically well-defined (e.g., the dual variables are not unique)\n",
        "2. The calculations performed by the optimization solver may become numerically poorly scaled\n",
        "3. Theoretical convergence properties of optimization algorithms may not hold\n",
        "\n",
        "Put another way, for a deterministic (square) problem we required that the number of equality constraints be equal to the number of free variables. In this case, there appear to be two equality constraints but in reality there is effectively only one as the two constraints are the same. Thus, the problem is not well defined and there exist a family of solutions that can satisfy the constraints given; any combination of values for ``x1`` and ``x2`` that sum to one will satisfy the constraints as written.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, degeneracies are rarely as straight-forward as a duplicated constraint. A more common occurrence is a set of linearly dependent constraints; that is a system of constraints where one constraint in the set can be formed by a linear combination of other constraints in the set. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
        "& x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1 \\\\\n",
        "& 2x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_3 = 2 \\\\\n",
        "\\end{align*} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the second constraint can be formed by multiplying the first constraint by two. Another common example of linearly dependent constraints is the combination of a set of material balances for all components in a system and an overall material balance. In this case, the overall material balances can be formed by adding all the individual component balances together. Depending on the number of components being modeled, this system of constraints can be quite large, but the end result is the same; the model effectively has one less constraint than it would appear to have.\n",
        "\n",
        "The absolute best defense against this is to detect degenerate equations and reformulate the model to remove them; this is the purpose of Degeneracy Hunter. Let's see it in action."
