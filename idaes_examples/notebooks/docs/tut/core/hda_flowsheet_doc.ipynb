    "\n",
    "Hydrodealkylation is a chemical reaction that often involves reacting\n",
    "an aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence of hydrogen gas to form a\n",
    "simpler aromatic hydrocarbon devoid of functional groups. In this\n",
    "example, toluene will be reacted with hydrogen gas at high temperatures\n",
    " to form benzene via the following reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "**C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + CH<sub>4</sub>**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This reaction is often accompanied by an equilibrium side reaction\n",
    "which forms diphenyl, which we will neglect for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is based on the 1967 AIChE Student Contest problem as\n",
    "present by Douglas, J.M., Chemical  Design of Chemical Processes, 1988,\n",
    "McGraw-Hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowsheet that we will be using for this module is shown below with the stream conditions. We will be processing toluene and hydrogen to produce at least 370 TPY of benzene. As shown in the flowsheet, there are two flash tanks, F101 to separate out the non-condensibles and F102 to further separate the benzene-toluene mixture to improve the benzene purity.  Note that typically a distillation column is required to obtain high purity benzene but that is beyond the scope of this workshop. The non-condensibles separated out in F101 will be partially recycled back to M101 and the rest will be either purged or combusted for power generation.We will assume ideal gas for this flowsheet. The properties required for this module are available in the same directory:\n",

    "- hda_ideal_VLE.py\n",
    "- hda_reaction.py\n",
    "\n",
    "The state variables chosen for the property package are **flows of component by phase, temperature and pressure**. The components considered are: **toluene, hydrogen, benzene and methane**. Therefore, every stream has 8 flow variables, 1 temperature and 1 pressure variable. \n",

    "When a flowsheet contains a recycle loop, the outlet of a downstream unit becomes the inlet of an upstream unit, creating a cyclic dependency that prevents straightforward calculation of all stream conditions. The tear‐stream method is necessary because it “breaks” this loop: you select one recycle stream as the tear, assign it an initial guess, and then solve the rest of the flowsheet as if it were acyclic. Once the downstream units compute their outputs, you compare the calculated value of the torn stream to your initial guess and iteratively adjust until they coincide. Without tearing, the solver cannot establish a proper topological sequence or drive the recycle to convergence, making initialization—and ultimately steady‐state convergence—impossible.\n",
