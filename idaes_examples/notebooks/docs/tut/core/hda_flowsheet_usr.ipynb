        "The flowsheet that we will be using for this module is shown below with the stream conditions. We will be processing toluene and hydrogen to produce at least 370 TPY of benzene. As shown in the flowsheet, there are two flash tanks, F101 to separate out the non-condensibles and F102 to further separate the benzene-toluene mixture to improve the benzene purity.  Note that typically a distillation column is required to obtain high purity benzene but that is beyond the scope of this workshop. The non-condensibles separated out in F101 will be partially recycled back to M101 and the rest will be either purged or combusted for power generation.We will assume ideal gas for this flowsheet.

The tear\u2010stream method is necessary because it \u201cbreaks\u201d this loop: you select one recycle stream as the tear, assign it an initial guess, and then solve the rest of the flowsheet as if it were acyclic. Once the downstream units compute their outputs, you compare the calculated value of the torn stream to your initial guess and iteratively adjust until they coincide.
