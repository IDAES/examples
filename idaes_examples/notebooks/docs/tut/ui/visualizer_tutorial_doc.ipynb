    "\n",
    "  * name: Name of flowsheet to display as the title of the visualization\n",
    "  * load_from_saved: If True load from saved file if any. Otherwise create\n",
    "    a new file or overwrite it (depending on 'overwrite' flag).\n",
    "  * save: Where to save the current flowsheet layout and values. If this argument is not specified,\n",
    "    \"``name``.json\" will be used (if this file already exists, a \"-`<version>`\" number will be added\n",

    "    will be saved. The boolean 'True' value is treated the same as unspecified.\n",
    "  * save_dir: If this argument is given, and ``save`` is not given or a relative path, then it will\n",
    "    be used as the directory to save the default or given file. The current working directory is\n",
    "    the default. If ``save`` is given and an absolute path, this argument is ignored.\n",
    "  * save_time_interval: The time interval that the UI application checks if any changes has occurred\n",
    "    in the graph for it to save the model. Default is 5 seconds\n",
    "  * overwrite: If True, and the file given by ``save`` exists, overwrite instead of creating a new\n",
    "    numbered file.\n",
    "  * browser: If true, open a browser\n",
    "  * port: Start listening on this port. If not given, find an open port.\n",
    "  * log_level: An IDAES logging level, which is a superset of the built-in `logging` module levels.\n",
    "    See the `idaes.logger` module for details\n",
    "  * quiet: If True, suppress printing any messages to standard output (console)\n",

    "Brushing refers to the ability to have actions in one visual area influence the display in another. It is commonly used in statistics to show how points in one scatterplot correspond to their points in another, for the same samples. Here, we use it to link the position of a stream in the diagram with its variable values in the stream table.\n",

    "2. Find the vapor outlet of F101 by looking for the arc connecting to the splitter and compressor feedback loop. This is stream `s06`. Then look at the same row for the Benzene vapor mol fraction and see that the value is $0.14916$\n",

    "To reload the saved layout, simply choose the same title (since the filename, by default, matches the title) or explicitly use the `save` and `save_dir` keywords for the `visualize()` function to select a previously saved file. This means you only need to manually lay out the diagram once. Of course, if you add new pieces to the flowsheet you will need to position them correctly (as discussed below)."
