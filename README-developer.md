## Installation

Clone the repository from Github, setup your Python environment as you usually do, then run pip with the developer requirements:

```shell
# to create a conda environment first:
# conda create -n idaes-examples python=3; conda activate idaes-examples
pip install -e .[dev,jb]
```

The configuration of the installation is stored in `pyproject.toml`.
 
## File layout

This section describes the internal organization of the example notebooks and supporting files.

### Directories
The examples are divided into a few top-level directories.

* `notebooks`: All the active/tested Jupyter notebooks and supporting data
  * `docs`: Examples and tutorials that will be tested and also published in the online documentation.
  * `active`: Not published but tested against new PRs
  * `_dev`: Notebooks used as examples for development and testing only.
  * `held`: Not published and *not* tested. For the next release (or removal).
* `mod`: Supporting Python modules (as a Python package).  
  It is usually best to match the name of the Python subpackage with its notebook directory.

For guidance on where to put a new notebook, see the [Examples Standards][standards] page in the IDAES examples repo wiki.

## Running tests

### Integration tests

Run integration tests from the top-level (root) directory of the repository.
In the root directory, tests are configured by `pyproject.toml`; see the *tool.pytest.ini_options* section.

```shell
# from the root directory of the repository
pytest idaes_examples
```

#### Testing a subset of the notebooks

To test just one notebook, you need to use the name of the *test* notebook not the source.
For example, to test the `compressor_src.ipynb` notebook (in the `unit_models/operations` subdirectory)
you need to add `-c` and the path to the top-level *pyproject.toml*, which has the pytest configuration,
then use the name of the test notebook:

```shell
pytest -v idaes_examples/notebooks/docs/unit_models/operations/compressor_test.ipynb
```

If you want to test several related notebooks, or perhaps just not type the whole notebook filename,
you can use the pytest `-k` flag to test all notebooks whose path matches a string (see pytest docs for details).
So, for example, from the top-level directory if you want to test all the *docs/unit_models/operations* notebooks,
you could take advantage of the fact that "operations" appears only in this particular path:

```shell
pytest -v idaes_examples -k operations
# will match: 
# docs/unit_models/operations/compressor_test.ipynb
# docs/unit_models/operations/heat_exchanger_0d_test.ipynb
# docs/unit_models/operations/mixer_test.ipynb
# docs/unit_models/operations/heater_test.ipynb
# docs/unit_models/operations/skeleton_unit_test.ipynb
# docs/unit_models/operations/pump_test.ipynb
# docs/unit_models/operations/turbine_test.ipynb
```

## Building documentation

**Note:** Building the documentation runs all the notebooks.
This is very slow, so is not an operation that a developer should perform during their regular workflow. 
Notebooks should be written with *unit tests* (see above) that can be run quickly to check correctness and syntax during creation and debugging.

The documentation is built using [Jupyterbook][jb].
We have written a thin layer around the Jupyterbook executable, which is installed as a command-line program *idaesx*.
To build the documentation, run:

```shell
idaesx build
```

The output will be in *idaes_examples/nb/_build/html*. As a convenience, you can open that HTML file with the command `idaesx view`.

## Preprocessing notebooks

The commands to run tests and build documentation both run a preprocessing step that creates separate copies of the Jupyter notebooks that are used for tests, tutorial exercise and solution, and documentation (see Notebook Names).
These generated files should ***not*** be added to the repository.
If you want to run that preprocessing step separately, use `idaesx pre`.
To remove pre-processed files, run `idaesx clean`.

A diagram of how preprocessing relates to notebook usage is shown below:

```

                 └──►│example_solution.ipynb│
                     └──────────────────────┘
```

## Notebook names

Notebooks all have a file name that fits the pattern notebook-name`_<ext>`.ipynb*.
When creating or modifying notebooks, you should always use `<ext>` = *src*.
Other extensions are automatically generated when running tests, building the documentation, and manually running the preprocessing step.
See the <a href="#table-nbtypes">table of notebook types</a> for details.

## How to add a new notebook

There are two main steps to creating a new notebook example.

1. Add Jupyter Notebook and supporting files
   1. See the [standards][standards] to figure out the parent directory for the notebook -- usually, it's *docs*.
   2. Put the notebook in the appropriate subdirectory.
      If you create a new directory for the notebook, the directory name *should* be in lowercase 
      with underscores between words. For example: '*docs/machine_learning*'.
   3. Notebook filename *should* be in lowercase with underscores and ***must*** end with '_src.ipynb'. For example: 
      'my_example_src.ipynb'.
   4. Add -- in the same directory as the notebook -- any data files or images it needs.
   5. Additional Python modules should be put in an appropriate place under *idaes_examples/mod*.
      Then your notebook can write: `from idaes_examples.mod.<subpackage> import <bla>`
2. Add Jupyter notebook to the Jupyterbook table of contents in *idaes_examples/notebooks/_toc.yml*.
   1. The notebook will be a *section*. If you added a new directory, you will create a new *chapter*, otherwise it will go under an existing one. See [Jupyterbook][jb] documentation for more details.
   2. Refer to the notebook as '*path/to/notebook-name*_doc' (replace '_src' with '_doc' and drop the '.ipynb' extension). For example: 'machine_learning/my_example_doc'.
   3. If you created a new directory for this notebook, make sure you add an *index.md* file to it. See other *index.md* files for the expected format.

You *should*  test the new notebook and build it locally before pushing the new file, i.e., run `pytest` and `idaesx build`.
Note that the cache for the documentation will be updated to contain the new output cells, which will modify files in *idaes_examples/notebooks/nbcache*; these files should also be committed and pushed.

### Jupyter Notebook file extensions

Each source Jupyter notebook (ending in '_src.ipynb') is preprocessed to create additional notebooks which are a copy of the original with some cells (steps in the notebook execution) removed.

<a name="table-nbtypes"></a>

| Notebook type | Description                | Ends with       |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| source        | Notebook source            | _src.ipynb      |
| testing       | Run for testing            | _test.ipynb     |
| exercise      | Tutorial exercises only    | _exercise.ipynb |
| solution      | Tutorial ex. and solutions | _solution.ipynb |
| documentation | Show in documentation      | _doc.ipynb      |
| user          | Run by end-users           | _usr.ipynb      |

### Jupyter Notebook cell tags

Preprocessing uses the feature of Jupyter notebook [cell tags][celltags] to understand which additional notebooks to 
create.

The following tags are understood by the preprocessing step:

<a name="table-nbtags"></a>

* testing: Remove this cell, except in the *testing* notebooks
* exercise: The presence of this tag means a notebook is a tutorial.
    Generate an _exercise_ and _solution_ notebook, and keep this cell in both. Remove this cell in the _documentation_ notebook.
* solution: The presence of this tag means a notebook is a tutorial.
    Generate an _exercise_ and _solution_ notebook, but remove this cell in the *solution* notebook; keep the cell in the _documentation_ notebook.
* noauto: This tag means that this cell should not be run during automated 
    notebook execution. The cell will be removed in _testing_ and _documentation_ notebooks.
* auto: This tag means that this cell should **only** be run during automated 
    notebook execution. The cell will be removed in all notebooks **except** _testing_ and _documentation_.         

All other tags, including the standard [Jupyterbook tags][hidecell] for hiding or removing cells, will be ignored.

#### Cell tags tutorial

An example of these tags, with a tutorial on how to set them, is in the `_dev/notebooks/ex/notebook_tags_example_src.
ipynb` 
notebook. In this directory the pre-processed output notebooks have been added to Git so you can see what they look 
like (without having to run `idaesx pre` yourself).

You can see the results by building the development notebooks into a documentation tree with `idaesx build 
--dev` (from the same directory you would normally run).
The output will be in `_dev/notebooks/_build/html`.

### Jupyter notebook metadata

In addition to per-cell tags, the preprocessor also can look at notebook-level metadata.
This is currently used for only one purpose: to tell the preprocessor not to generate a 'test' notebook, and thereby to skip the given notebook in the tests.
In order to make this happen, either manually edit the notebook source or use the Jupyter notebook "Edit -> Edit Notebook Metadata" menu item to add the following section to the notebook-level metadata:
```
"idaes": {
   "skip": ["test"]
}
```

## Copyright headers

You can add (and update) copyright headers to Python files _and_ Jupyter Notebooks using the 
`addheader` command with the included `addheader.yml` configuration file:

```bash
# first see what would be changed (using -n)
addheader -n -c addheader.yml
# if this is OK, add the headers
addheader -c addheader.yml
```

All existing notebooks and Python files will be automatically discovered and modified as needed.
